Differnce between window and document object :
 
Window object:

It defines window (or)tab from one browser. 
Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 
Eg: window.location;
    window.location.href;       // (To get URL)
    window.location.protocol;   // (To get http)
    window.location.host;       // (To print the host)
    window.setTimeout(()=> console.log('will be printed after 3 seconds'),3000); // (To print after taking three seconds)

Document object:

It represent the complete HTML document of the browser and we can identify the elements inside of the document.
With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.  
Eg:
document.querySelector('p');
document.querySelector('p').textContent;  //(to get paragraph as a String)
